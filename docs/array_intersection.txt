NAME
	array_intersection - find intersection of two sorted int arrays

SYNOPSIS
	#include <user/user.h>

	int* array_intersection(int* arr1, int* arr2, int size1, int size2, int *new_size);

DESCRIPTION
	array_intersection() finds the intersection of two sorted integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. The intersection 
  includes elements that exist in both arrays. The function also removes duplicates from the resulting intersection.
  array_intersection() will do an early return if either of the provided arrays is NULL. The memory allocation done
  in the function must be freed in the caller method.

RETURN VALUE
	int* (pointer to a new array containing the intersection elements) or NULL (either array is null or allocation failure)
