NAME
	strncat - concatenate a null-padded character sequence into a string

SYNOPSIS
	#include "user/string.h"
	
	char *strncat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, uint n);

DESCRIPTION
	strncat() catenates the input character sequence contained in a null-padded fixed-
	width buffer, into a string at the buffer pointed to by dst. The programmer is 
	responsible for allocating a destination buffer large enough, that is,
	strlen(dst) + strnlen(src, n) + 1

RETURN VALUE
	returns dst.
